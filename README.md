# Goodwin Front-end Assignment

Hey there team Goodwin! Welcome to the my front-end assignment repo.

Here's some info: I used the [Mantine Next.js template](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template) to get me started.

I've never used Mantine before. It's pretty nice, and I enjoyed it.

Feel free to ask me any questions, but I left some comments in the code explaning why I did certain things (mainly because this is an exercise).

If I went forward with this: I'd create Storybook stories for the components, abstract out more reusable components, add more fallbacks, etc. There's always room to make everything better.

Let me know what you think, and thanks for checking it out.

## npm scripts
- `dev` – start dev server
- `build` – bundle application for production
- `analyze` – analyzes application bundle with [@next/bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/bundle-analyzer)
- `test` – runs `jest`, `prettier:check`, `lint` and `typecheck` scripts
